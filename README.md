No-name parts is a utility providing enhancements and tweaks for the 
[No-name Cyanogenmod 10.1 build](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2159089) for
the Asus Transformer TF101.

It may be useful for other similar devices.

## Features

* Configurable
* Always force landscape rotation when docked in keyboard dock.

## TODO

* Add ability to configure touch-pad.
* Add ability to force-mount MicroSD-cardswhich vold is unable to handle (like exfat).
* Add update-detection and download. Should check for releases on pre-made index on server.

### Update-detection

Should be able to automatically filter on device, build-type (from CM-version) and have a
preference for wheter to check for updates, and wheter tabletUI should be required before
an new update is interesting.
